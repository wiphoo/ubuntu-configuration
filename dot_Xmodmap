!!!!	I use the numeric keypad really often, so I keep NumLock on. But NEdit shortcuts don't work when NumLock is on.
!!!!
!!!!	The bug is not in NEdit, but in Motif. This is fixed as of NEdit 5.2, but
!!!!	that might not help you much. Older versions have the same problem.
!!!! 
!!!!	Here's how you tell X to interpret the keypad keys as numbers without
!!!!	turning NumLock on. Create a file .Xmodmap in your home directory, and put
!!!!	the following lines in it:

keycode 79 = KP_7
keycode 80 = KP_8
keycode 81 = KP_9
keycode 83 = KP_4
keycode 84 = KP_5
keycode 85 = KP_6
keycode 87 = KP_1
keycode 88 = KP_2
keycode 89 = KP_3
keycode 90 = KP_0
keycode 91 = KP_Decimal
